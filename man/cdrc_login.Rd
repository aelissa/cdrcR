\title{Login to the CDRC}
\usage{
cdrc_login(username, password)
}
\arguments{
\item{username}{A character-string with your CDRC username.}

\item{password}{A character-string with your CDRC password.}
}
\value{
A response message which confirms the login was successful and how to see the API key.
}
\description{
This function will log in a CDRC user based on the username and password. If you do not
have a CDRC user yet, please register on https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/user/register
When you log in an api token is automatically generated, saved in your R environment and loaded in the current session, no further action is required from you to access the API.
}
\details{
For safety reasons the API token will expire in 24h. This means that after 24h you need to log in again to generate a new API token which will be self-updated and load.
As the API token is loaded in the current session if you restart the session you need to login again.
